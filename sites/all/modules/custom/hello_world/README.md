Hello World Exercise

The goal of this exercise is for us to get to know how you go about programming a custom Drupal module. There are two items you'll send back to us: 1) a zipped module folder and 2) a brief document describing the decision-making you used during the creation of the module.

Step 1. Install and enable the attached Features-created module (content_type_vocab_hello_world.zip). It will create a taxonomy vocabulary called "Sections" and a content type called "Hello World Article" that you'll need to use. If these do not appear in your Drupal site, you may need to install the Features module.

Step 2. Create the following terms in the Sections vocabulary:

"About Us" - make sure its Enabled box is checked.
"Misc" - make sure its Enabled box is checked.
"News" - make sure its Enabled box is unchecked.

Step 3. Create 4 content nodes using the Hello World Article content type. Two nodes should be tagged with the "News" value only in the Sections field. The other two should be tagged once in the Sections field with "About Us" on one node and "Misc" on the last node.

Step 4. Set Bartik as the default theme if it isn't set as the default already.

Step 5. Read the requirements below...

The text "Hello World!" should appear in a bold typeface on the right side of all Hello World Article pages only.
A block listing hyperlinked titles to all nodes that are of Hello World Article type, and are tagged with "Enabled" terms from the Sections vocabulary, should appear below the "Hello World!" text on Hello World Article pages.
When viewing a Hello World Article on the Drupal site, the phrase "Content starts here!" should appear in an italic typeface as the first line of content on the page.

All of this functionality needs to be contained in one Drupal module (not a Features module). The only module's dependencies should be Drupal core modules and the content_type_vocab_hello_world module.
Name the module "hello_world".
Compatible with Drupal 7.
Step 6. Briefly document how these feature will be built in written format, describing the thinking and approach to fulfilling the requirements. E-mail, Word or text file will suffice.

Step 7. Write the module.

Step 8. Once completed, zip the module folder and documentation, then send to kevin.basarab@mediacurrent.com and paul.chason@mediacurrent.com.

Take 3 days to complete the assignment.
